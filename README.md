# Diabetes Classification Using K-Nearest Neighbour Algorithm
The Training and testing data is provided in the repository
We will be using K nearest algorithm
Separate functions are made for the algorithm
if wanted to use the algorithm, just take the dist and knn functions
Only CSV/ numpy format is supported so conversion is mandatory
data visualization can be seen at the end

## Requirements
- Pandas(v1.0.4)
- Numpy(v1.18+)
- Matplotlib(v3.2+)[Only for visualization)
